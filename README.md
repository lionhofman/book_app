# Book App
This is a Flutter book app that utilizes the Google Books API (https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes) to create a book browsing and searching experience. The app allows users to search for books by providing a keyword and displays related books. Users can mark books as favorites to keep them visible even when offline. Additionally, users can view detailed information about each book and, if available, are provided with a link to purchase the book.

# Features
## The Book App includes the following features:
1. Book Search: Users can enter a keyword in the search box to find related books.
2. List of Results: The app displays a list of books related to the user's search query, showing basic details such as title, author, and book cover.
3. Book Details: Users can tap on a book to view detailed information such as synopsis, publication date, and page count.
4. Favorites: Users can mark books as favorites to access them easily later. The app stores the data of favorited books locally, allowing access even when offline.
5. Purchase Redirection: When available, the app provides a link that redirects users to the book's purchase page, enabling them to buy directly from the vendor.
